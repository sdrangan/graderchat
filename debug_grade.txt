=== Reference Problem (LaTeX) ===
\item \emph{Propagation delay}:  A signal $x$ has time-value change points
\[
    (10, 0), (20, 4), (30, 2)
\]
where the time is in nanoseconds.  The signal is passed through
a circuit that produces $y = 2x+1$ with a propagation delay of \SI{3}{ns}.
What are the time-value change points of $y$?  Use $\text{x}$ for unknown values.

=== Reference Solution ===
The change points of $y$ are:
\[
    (10,\text{x}), (13, 1), (20,\text{x}), (23, 9), (30,\text{x}), (33, 5).
\]
Note that output is unknown for \SI{3}{ns} after each input change.

=== Grading Notes ===
The common mistake is to forget to add the unknown period.
